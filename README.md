# Bulls and Cows

Bulls and Cows is a popular word guessing game where the objective is to guess a hidden word. The game provides the player with a number of bulls and cows, which are hints about the hidden word. A bull indicates that a letter in the player's guess is correct and is in the correct position. A cow indicates that a letter in the player's guess is correct but is in the wrong position.

For example, if the hidden word is "heat" and the player guesses "teal", the game will provide the player with 2 bulls and 1 cow. The player must use these hints to guess the hidden word before running out of attempts.

Bulls and Cows is a fun and challenging game that tests the player's ability to think logically and make deductions. It is suitable for players of all ages.
